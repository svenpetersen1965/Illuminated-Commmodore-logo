# Illuminated-Commodore-logo
This is, what you need for your hobby retro computer projects: a Commodore logo, which is illuminated with two LEDs!

This project consists out of a 3D printed logo and a PCB that contains the LEDs and limiting resistors. 

The 3D print is made from three parts:
1. The illuminated body, which is printed with transparent PLA
2. A face plate
3. A reflector

The transparent part is printed with 100% infill (important!). I have printed it upright (on the side with the LED holes). 

There are two types of face plates: one with rounded corners and one without. It should be printed from a material, that is not any translucent. Black is a good color. White is not so suitable. 

The orientation of the reflector while printng is not so important. It should be printed with a white filament.

The Fusion 360 design is contained in this project.
